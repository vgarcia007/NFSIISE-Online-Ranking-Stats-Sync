# NFSIISE
Online Time Sync for Need for Speed 2: Special Edition

## What is this?
This script/program uploads your saved game (record tables) to https://garcias-garage.de.

The website creates a ranking table for all tracks and players.

The script syncs it back to your game.

## Wich version do i choose?

It depends on the version of your game.

The preferred and simpler version is from zaps166: https://github.com/zaps166/NFSIISE/releases.

Alternatively, there is the version from Verok: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B63wtSeJJj57gdjeTf9TGFXz_da8Wx2v/view with the use of nglide (https://www.zeus-software.com/downloads/nglide).
